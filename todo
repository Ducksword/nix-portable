# make a just recipe that installs home-manager
probably will have to chroot into install

# gnome
## remove excess packages
## configure default settings for home-manager?
## add declarations for extensions

# flatpak
## add flatpak nix support has to piggy off of home-manager
install after chroot
    depends on home-manager
add support for flatpak backup and restore

```
see if home-manager can manage a script that installs
flatpak. if not just use a shell script that can be run anywhere.
